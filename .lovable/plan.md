## Plan: Update HTML Title

Change the document title in `index.html` from "Lovable App" to "Brady Scorecard". This includes updating the `<title>` tag and the `og:title` meta tag for consistency.

### File: `index.html`
- Line 7: Change `<title>Lovable App</title>` to `<title>Brady Scorecard</title>`
- Line 13: Change `og:title` content from "Lovable App" to "Brady Scorecard"
